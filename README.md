# Threat Detection Report 2022 – Deep Analysis & SOC Notes

This repository contains a complete, structured, and deeply analyzed breakdown of the **Red Canary Threat Detection Report 2022**.  
The goal is not to reproduce the original report, but to provide **analyst-grade notes**, **detection logic**, **MITRE ATT&CK mappings**, and **practical SOC insights** based on the concepts discussed in the report.

This project is designed as a **learning resource**, a **SOC analyst reference**, and a **portfolio piece** demonstrating threat analysis, detection engineering, and defensive thinking.
